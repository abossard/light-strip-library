## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abossard/light-strip-library.git
   cd light-strip-library
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The demo will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

5. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   # Install Playwright browsers (first time only)
   npx playwright install
   
   # Run screenshot tests
   npm run screenshot
   ```

## Making Changes

### Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes:**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow existing code style
   - Add TypeScript types where appropriate
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Test your changes:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run dev  # Manually test in browser
   npm run screenshot  # Run automated tests
   ```

4. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   ```

### Types of Contributions

- **Bug fixes:** Fix issues in existing functionality
- **New features:** Add new LED patterns, animations, or capabilities
- **Documentation:** Improve README, add examples, fix typos
- **Performance:** Optimize rendering or animation performance
- **Tests:** Add or improve test coverage

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
3. Test different LED strip configurations
4. Try various animation patterns
5. Check console for any errors

### Automated Testing

The project uses Playwright for screenshot testing:

```bash
# Run all screenshot tests
npm run screenshot

# View test results
npx playwright show-report
```

### Testing New Features

When adding new features:
1. Test with different LED strip configurations (straight, circular, square)
2. Test with different numbers of LEDs
3. Verify animations work smoothly
4. Check for memory leaks in long-running animations
5. Test color transitions and effects

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Push your branch:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request:**
   - Go to the repository on GitHub
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select your branch
   - Fill in the PR template with:
     - Description of changes
     - Screenshots/GIFs if UI changes
     - Testing performed
     - Any breaking changes

3. **Address review feedback:**
   - Make requested changes
   - Push updates to your branch
   - Respond to reviewer comments

4. **Merge:**
   - Once approved, your PR will be merged
   - Delete your feature branch after merge

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Include tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep changes minimal and relevant

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define types for function parameters and return values
- Avoid `any` type when possible
- Use interfaces for object shapes

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use TypeScript for prop types

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons at end of statements
- Use single quotes for strings
- Keep lines under 100 characters when practical
- Add comments for complex logic

### Naming Conventions

- **Files:** PascalCase for components (`LightStrip.tsx`), camelCase for utilities (`logger.ts`)
- **Components:** PascalCase (`LightStripComponent`)
- **Functions:** camelCase (`setLEDColor`)
- **Constants:** UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`DEFAULT_LED_COUNT`)
- **Types/Interfaces:** PascalCase (`ColorSetup`, `LightStripDetails`)

### Git Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- First line: brief summary (50 chars or less)
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Body: explain what and why, not how

Examples:
```
Add rainbow wave animation pattern

Implement smooth color transition across all LEDs in a wave pattern.
Includes configurable wave speed and color spectrum.
```
